This is paper implementation of paper On Analyzing Graphs with Motif-Paths

Project Description:
1.Implementation of algorithms for analyzing motif-paths, including shortest motif path (SMP), motif-path based link prediction, motif-path based node ranking, and multi-level graph clustering.
2.The algorithms are implemented in C++
3.The project demonstrates the ability of motif-paths to uncover higher-order semantics in graphs and enhance various analysis techniques like node ranking, link prediction, and graph clustering.

Installation:
These programs are  run in Dev C++ 5.11 IDE 
Download all four algorithmsa and run them via Dev C++  to get the results.
we also provided addtional datasets that you use to run
